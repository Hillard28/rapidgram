# rapidgram
Cythonized version of fuzzygram.

Tool for measuring string similarities based on pseudo-Jaccard Similarity scoring.  The base method (ratio) is derived from the wonderful [matchit](https://github.com/julioraffo/matchit) ADO created by Julio Raffo.  String preprocessing functions are derived from custom Stata code written by Sergey Chernenko.
